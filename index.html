            When a man and woman are married in the temple, their family can be together forever. This is a common goal of Latter-day Saints.Those who are married should consider their union as their most cherished earthly relationship. A spouse is the only person other than the Lord whom we have been commanded to love with all our heart. Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither person exercising dominion over the other but with each encouraging, comforting, and helping the other.
          </p><br>
          <p >Marriage partners must be loyal to one another and faithful in their marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. The Lord has said, ““Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <em>Ephesians 5:23 KJV </em>

          <ol>
             <li class="">
            Couples should work together to manage their finances and cooperate in establishing and following a budget. Wise money management and freedom from debt contribute to peace in the home.
              </li><br>
              <li class="">Married couples should stay away from anything that could lead to unfaithfulness in any way. Pornography, unwholesome fantasies, and flirtations will erode character and strike at the foundation of marriage.</li><br>
              <li class="">Finally, couples must center their lives in the gospel of Jesus Christ. As couples help one another keep the covenants they have made, attend church and the temple together, study the scriptures together, and kneel together in prayer, God will guide them. Their companionship will sweeten through the years; their love will strengthen. Their appreciation for one another will grow.

             <h1 class="">Family</h1>
            <div>
               <p>The Lord has designated the family to be the basic unit of the Church and of society. As used in the scriptures, a family consists of a husband and wife, children, and sometimes other relatives living in the same house or under one family head. A family can also be a single person living alone, a single parent with children, or a husband and wife without children.

              <h3 class="family-content-text">Family Councils</h3>
              <p>Family councils help family members seek the Lord’s will in unity and faith. In a family council, family members talk together, share feelings and ideas, and agree on a plan of action. Family councils may be held whenever needed. Some families may decide to hold their councils on a regular schedule, while others may hold them as needed. Sometimes, parents may want to hold a family council on the Sabbath or in connection with home evening.
                Respect for the opinions and feelings of others is essential to the success of family councils. Parents lead in a family council, but they often listen much more than they speak. They help all family members participate with love, respect, kindness, and patience. When family councils are filled with Christlike love and guided by the Lord’s Spirit, they help protect family members from the evils of the world.

              <p class="family-content-text">Prophets have counseled parents to teach their children to love God and to keep His commandments. Home evening is a designated weekly time for individuals and families to study the gospel and spend time together.Home evenings could include prayer, uplifting music, gospel instruction, service, sharing talents, and activities. They should also include family councils, where family members set goals, resolve problems, coordinate schedules, and give support to one another.Home evenings can be held on Sundays, on Mondays, or at other times that best meet the needs of individuals and families. Church leaders should keep Monday evenings free from Church meetings and activities. All will be blessed for participating in home evenings.</p>
