            When a man and woman are married in the temple, their family can be together forever. This is a common goal of Latter-day Saints.Those who are married should consider their union as their most cherished earthly relationship. A spouse is the only person other than the Lord whom we have been commanded to love with all our heart. Marriage, in its truest sense, is a partnership of equals, with neither person exercising dominion over the other but with each encouraging, comforting, and helping the other.
          </p><br>
          <p >Marriage partners must be loyal to one another and faithful in their marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. The Lord has said, ““Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <em>Ephesians 5:23 KJV </em>

            Couples should work together to manage their finances and cooperate in establishing and following a budget. Wise money management and freedom from debt contribute to peace in the home.
              </li><br>
              <li class="">Married couples should stay away from anything that could lead to unfaithfulness in any way. Pornography, unwholesome fantasies, and flirtations will erode character and strike at the foundation of marriage.</li><br>
              <li class="">Finally, couples must center their lives in the gospel of Jesus Christ. As couples help one another keep the covenants they have made, attend church and the temple together, study the scriptures together, and kneel together in prayer, God will guide them. Their companionship will sweeten through the years; their love will strengthen. Their appreciation for one another will grow.
